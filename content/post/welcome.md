Welcome to my website and blog.

I am a computer game programmer based in Stockholm Sweden. I am going to provide services for game programming, especially mathematical applications.

However I am not yet available for hire but will be soon, earliest in autumn of 2019 and later.

I am also going to develop this website, add content and prepare the site for business use.
